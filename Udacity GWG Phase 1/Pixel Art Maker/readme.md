This is the final project of the Grow With Google and Udacity Scholarship Program.  It is a combination of HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills that I have learned throughout this course.  Below is a screenshot of the final project.  I plan on rewriting this project in "vanilla" JavaScript at a later date to help solidify the knowledge I gained during this course.
