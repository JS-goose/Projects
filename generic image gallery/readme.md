This is a generic image gallery I built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  It is free to use without attribution.  You will need to add your own images, however.  

Here is an example of what this image gallery can look like after you've added your own pictures.  There is no JavaScript or backend associated with the "login" so you will need to do that yourself.
