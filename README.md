# Projects

Projects from many different sources (courses I've taken, ideas I've had, etc.).

I have built these projects with my own knowledge and skill after completing respective courses/material.

Each source I've used has it's own folder and corresponding files unless I have forgotten where the idea came from or used the original idea and expanded upon that.

Some of these courses are paid and some are free, I will note this in the list below. Eventually I'll get around to adding a comprehensive list of the all the resources I've used but if you'd like a list of a few you can find them below (in no particular order):
