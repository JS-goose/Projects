### fCC Tribute Page

This is the tribute page I built as part of the freeCodeCamp cirriculum _before_ it was revamped.  I will be rebuilding this when I get to that point in the program.  For now if you'd like to learn more visit <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>

Below is the image of my brother, who I built my tribute page for.
